Xledger is an ERP application exposing a SOAP webservice. There are multiple methods and this element is a starting point supporting the Authentication and Fileupload API.

The native authentication functionality is a separate SOAP call but has been migrated into just one element for ease of use.  The main resource we worked on apart from authentication is receive file and is helpful given it exposes attributes instead of just having to upload a CSV file
