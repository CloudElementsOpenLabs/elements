With it you can manage your accounts for receiving funds, exchange in up to 34 currencies with live market rates aggregated from 14 partner banks for best execution and make payments globally with our optimised payment network, all supported by our in house systems that pre-validate your recipients en mass, reducing the risk of payment failures or delays in processing. \r\n\r\nWe recommend you read through the API documentation in full to familiarise yourself with the features and workflows associated with the product. Demo accounts and sandbox access can be provisioned for you by your moneycorp representative. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\nBelow is a brief description of each of our API features:\r\n\r\n**Login API:**\r\nBefore using the API, you must first obtain an authentication token by specifying the Login ID and API key provided to you directly. This token must be present in the Authorization HTTP header when making all other API calls.  \r\n\r\n**Accounts API:**\r\nUsed to manage your accounts, all objects created in our API are done in the context of an account, these endpoints allow you to look up and locate the relevant account to use for subsequent calls. \r\n\r\n**Balances API:**\r\nUsed to view the balances of your moneycorp receiving accounts, split into each of the currencies supported by the moneycorp API. \r\n\r\n**Recipients API:**\r\nOur recipients API allows you to create, validate and retrieve your recipients for subsequent payments. We use our in house solution to ensure data is validated prior to payment submission to ensure delivery of funds and avoid any delays in processing. \r\n\r\n**Payments API:**\r\nOur payments API is designed to allow you create payments en mass to nearly every country in the world using a range of local and direct clearing methods. You can use these endpoints to search previously sent payments, check status or create new payments. \r\n\r\n**Reference API:**\r\nOur reference API is designed to provide you with all the information you should need to make full use of our other endpoints, such as recipient requirements, payment holidays and supported countries and currencies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\nAn example workflow is set out below for guidance on how the moneycorp API operates in practice.\r\n\r\nIn this example, we want to make a &pound;100,000 GBP payment to a recipient based in the UK.\r\n\r\n**1.\tLogin to the API:**\r\nTo begin you will need to obtain an access token to allow you to reach all other API endpoints. Using your unique Login ID and API key provided you can call the login API endpoint. On success, an access token will be granted.\r\n\r\n**2.\tGet your account details:**\r\nNext you should retrieve all your accounts associated to your API user so when you move into creating payments they are done under the relevant account, most endpoints will also require an account ID. \r\n\r\n**3.\tCheck recipient field requirements:**\r\nNext you may want to setup some recipients to send payments to, you can use our Get Recipient Requirements endpoint to understand what information you must provide for a recipient in a given country/currency combination. For this example we want to know what the requirements are for a recipient in the UK and a GBP account. \r\n\r\n**4.\tCreate a recipient:**\r\nNow once you have the required information for creating a recipient you can perform this action using our create recipient endpoint, we will also validate the details provided as well to avoid any delays in processing of payments. \r\n\r\n**5.\tCreate a payment:**\r\nOnce the recipient has been created you can now create a payment for it using the recipient ID and passing it into the Create Payment endpoint, you can create many payments to single recipients. \r\n\r\n**6.\tCheck your balance:**\r\nPayments will only be released once there are sufficient funds available on your account balance, you can do this by paying directly into your moneycorp account. You can pay into your moneycorp account using your account reference found on the Get Account endpoint.  Then you can use the Get Balances endpoint to check your account balance.\r\n\r\n**7.\tCheck your payment&#39;s status:**\r\nFollowing a successful payment creation, updates on the status of the payment can be returned from the Get Payment endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Idempotency\r\nmoneycorp API utilises idempotency across all create endpoints in order to prevent duplicate creation of resources.\r\n\r\nIdempotency in the moneycorp API allows a user to safely retry a particular request, without the potentially unintended consequences of performing an operation multiple times. This is required for the situation when a response message is not received for a create request (for example: creating a payment). In this situation a client would be unaware whether the original request was processed and the response was lost in transit, or if the request was never received at all. In the case where the original request was processed subsequent retries of the request should not create duplicate resources. \r\n\r\nTo perform  an idempotent request you must provide an Idempotency-Key: &lt;key&gt; header when sending the request. The key is a unique value that is generated by the client to identify a particular request. This key can be any format, however, we recommend using a GUID in order to reduce the chance of unintended duplicate keys. Keys expire after 15 minutes so requests are processed as usual if a key is reused outside that time.\r\n\r\nIf a request is received with a previously processed key one of three things will happen: \r\n- If the previous request is still being processed a Conflict (Http status code 409) error will be generated. \r\n- If the previous request was not successful the API will attempt to re-process the request. \r\n- If the previous request was successful a Conflict (Http status code 409) error will be generated. In addition the previous successful response will be included in the error payload.\r\n\r\n**Get** requests are by default idempotent so providing the Idempotency-Key header will have no impact and should not be sent.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Support \r\nFor any assistance through the integration, your moneycorp representative and implementation manager will be able to help guide you.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Important Notice:**\r\nThis API sandbox is a test environment that you can use to mimic the characteristics of the production environment. As a test environment, you represent and warrant not to use real data (including personal data) in the API sandbox under any circumstances.\r\n\r\n","eventTypes":["unknown"],"hasSandboxWarnings":false,"paginationMetadata":{},"authenticationTypes":["custom"],"hub":"finance","discovery":{"nativeObjectMetadataDiscovery":false,"vendorSupportCustomFieldsDiscovery":false,"supportCustomFieldsDiscovery":false,"nativeObjectDiscovery":false,"objectDiscoverySupport":false,"crudsSupported":false},"captured":false,"name":"Moneycorp","api":{"vendorLatestVersion":"v2","vendorDocumentationUrl":"https://sandbox-corpapi.moneycorp.com/swagger/index.html","vendorSupportWebhooks":false,"type":"unknown","version":"v2"},"extendable":true,"id":27805,"bulk":{"download":false,"upload":false,"ceSupportNativeBulkUpload":false,"vendorSupportNativeBulkDownload":false,"ceSupportNativeBulkDownload":false,"vendorSupportNativeBulkUpload":false},"beta":false,"key":"moneycorp_2"},"private":true,"configuration":[{"internal":false,"companyConfig":false,"defaultValue":"page","displayOrder":1,"active":true,"description":"moneycorp.Api Pagination Type","isPrivate":false,"type":"TEXTFIELD_32","resellerConfig":false,"required":false,"hideFromConsole":true,"name":"Pagination Type","id":382157,"groupControl":false,"key":"pagination.type"},{"internal":false,"companyConfig":false,"displayOrder":1,"active":true,"description":"access token","isPrivate":false,"type":"TEXTFIELD_128","resellerConfig":false,"required":false,"hideFromConsole":false,"name":"accessToken","id":382167,"groupControl":false,"key":"token"},{"internal":false,"companyConfig":false,"displayOrder":1,"active":true,"description":"expires in timeframe","isPrivate":false,"type":"TEXTFIELD_128","resellerConfig":false,"required":false,"hideFromConsole":false,"name":"expiresIn","id":382166,"groupControl":false,"key":"expires_in"},{"internal":false,"companyConfig":false,"defaultValue":"https://sandbox-corpapi.moneycorp.com","displayOrder":1,"active":true,"description":"moneycorp.Api Base URL","isPrivate":false,"type":"TEXTFIELD_1000","resellerConfig":false,"required":false,"hideFromConsole":true,"name":"Base URL","id":382153,"groupControl":false,"key":"base.url"},{"internal":false,"companyConfig":false,"displayOrder":1,"active":true,"description":"loginId","isPrivate":false,"type":"TEXTFIELD_128","resellerConfig":false,"required":true,"hideFromConsole":false,"name":"loginId","id":382151,"groupControl":false,"key":"loginid"},{"internal":false,"companyConfig":false,"displayOrder":1,"active":true,"description":"apiKey","isPrivate":false,"type":"TEXTFIELD_128","resellerConfig":false,"required":true,"hideFromConsole":false,"name":"apiKey","id":382154,"groupControl":false,"key":"apikey"},{"internal":false,"companyConfig":false,"defaultValue":"100","displayOrder":1,"active":true,"description":"The maximum number of records the API provider returns in a response","isPrivate":false,"type":"TEXTFIELD_32","resellerConfig":false,"required":false,"hideFromConsole":true,"name":"Max Page Size (or limit)","id":382156,"groupControl":false,"key":"pagination.max"},{"internal":false,"companyConfig":false,"displayOrder":11,"active":true,"description":"moneycorp.Api Event Notification Signature Key","isPrivate":false,"type":"TEXTFIELD_128","resellerConfig":false,"required":false,"hideFromConsole":true,"name":"Event Notification Signature Key","id":382158,"groupControl":false,"key":"event.notification.signature.key"},{"internal":false,"companyConfig":false,"displayOrder":12,"active":true,"description":"moneycorp.Api Event Notification Callback Headers","isPrivate":false,"type":"TEXTFIELD_128","resellerConfig":false,"required":false,"hideFromConsole":false,"name":"Event Notification Callback Headers","id":382160,"groupControl":false,"key":"event.notification.callback.headers"},{"internal":false,"companyConfig":false,"displayOrder":12,"active":true,"description":"moneycorp.Api Event Notification Basic User Name","isPrivate":false,"type":"TEXTFIELD_128","resellerConfig":false,"required":false,"hideFromConsole":false,"name":"Event Notification Basic User Name","id":382159,"groupControl":false,"key":"event.notification.basic.username"},{"internal":false,"companyConfig":false,"displayOrder":13,"active":true,"description":"moneycorp.Api Event Notification Basic Password","isPrivate":false,"type":"PASSWORD","resellerConfig":false,"required":false,"hideFromConsole":false,"name":"Event Notification Basic Password","id":382161,"groupControl":false,"key":"event.notification.basic.password"},{"internal":false,"companyConfig":false,"displayOrder":98,"active":true,"description":"Generic map used to specify default fields for bulk download and GET /all requests.
