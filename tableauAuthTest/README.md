This is a working version including authentication for the Tableau BI application. It only supports mySite and users for site + auth as resources but can easily be extended from here. Notice how most of the Tableau resources require the same parameter which has been automated in this element by saving it to the element configuration upon successful authentication.

Note: refresh token not implemented
No webhooks / events were added
