ABOUT: This Element was built for a POC for the Acquia Lift Profile Manager product and does not contain full functionality. It does, however, include a global prehook that runs before every call to calculate HMAC signatures for accessing their HMAC protected API's. It is an interesting use case that leverages the CryptoJS library.
