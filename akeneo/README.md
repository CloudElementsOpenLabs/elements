The Akeneo element (which is a PIM) exposes 2 resources from their API which gives you a head start bringing on more of their API resources onto the platform. The element is very basic but supports their OAuth2 authentication flow with the right credentials.
No eventing / webhooks have been added
The API is v1 and this is where the docs are located https://api.akeneo.com/api-reference-index.html
