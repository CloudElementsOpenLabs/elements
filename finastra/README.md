The Finastra fusion fabric platform exposes a large series of APIs that are separated per business functionality. This element combines the different B2B and Account information APIs into a single element.
On Fusion fabric you can create an oAuth2 app with key & secret which can then be entered in the configuration of this element.  

No events / webhooks were added to any of the resources but can be extended
