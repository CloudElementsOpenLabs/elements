# Contributing

Please be sure to review the [Open Labs Overview](https://docs.cloud-elements.com/home/open-labs-overview) before using this repo. 

To contribute we ask that you create a folder that contains the Element JSON as well as a short README file with a description of what you built (endpoint name and resources available so people can see them without importing the Element), a link to the documentation you used when creating the Element, and any known endpoint limitation that might affect how your Element works.

We’re still working out the kinks to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible. Hopefully this document makes the process for contributing clear and answers some questions that you may have.

### Our Standards

While we are happy to have a central place for developers to contribute and share and we welcome a wide array of contributions, we would still like to uphold a basic standard for Element expectations. If your Element does not meet these and you are interested in getting it working so you can contribute, please consider reaching out to implementation@cloud-elements.com where we are happy to help you get your Element up to standard prior to contributing.

### Getting Started
If this is the first Element that you are building or sharing Please see our Element builder documentation: https://docs.cloud-elements.com/home/element-builder-overview

For your own security, please make sure to remove any API keys and secrets or hard-coded personal data prior to uploading Elements. In the event that you accidentally leave these in the Element, your PR will be rejected.
